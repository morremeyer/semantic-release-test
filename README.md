# semantic-release-test

This is just a test repository for semantic release automation. You should probably ignore it.


## Releases

Releases are fully automated and happen on every feature and bug fix that is merged into the `main` branch.

Maintainers can manually trigger the release of a new version by creating the corresponding tag and pushing it. This is used to release new versions that only contain updates of dependencies.
